Thinking about the limitations of Android devices

Interview: 
Xiaoyan Xu
 - What do you like about notetaking apps?
  - Dragging images into the app
  - Displaying code (code blocks w/ syntax highlighting)
  - Dividing notes into categories, folders (sorting)

Licheng Zhang
 - What do you wish existed?
  - Recognizing handwritten math would be cool

Prof. Jeff Avery
 - What do you like in notetaking apps?
  - Likes Apple Notes (he cares about recording stuff in different devices, handwriting, images)
   - but hates that it's proprietary and rich text
  - Searchability of text notes and of pages
  - Markdown support w/ colours (cool to work with rich text + Markdown but really hard)
  - Doesn't care too much about basic formatting (bold, italicization)
  - Store as or export to .md ideally
  - Sorting
  - Timestamps

Decisions: We are targeting students

TODO:
 - Find people to interview
  - Jeff himself
  - Probably a TA or two
  - Friends (hopefully they don't sugarcoat)
  - Roommates

 - Make personas
 - Affinity chart
 - User Story Breakdown
 - Product Backlog (eventually)
