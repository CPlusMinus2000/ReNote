CS 398 Meeting Minutes

Date: January 21st, 2022
Team: CKC

Present: Ivan, Henry, Colin
Absent: Adam

Agenda: Discuss diagrams, ask questions about our current progress

Notes: Seems like we're doing okay so far, but there's a bit more
work we still need to take care of before our first demo

Decisions: Need to look at charts.
Ivan => interface design
Henry => Gantt chart
Colin => Personas, affinity chart
Adam => Gitlab wiki documentation

TODO: Make charts!
Think about design patterns (MVC???)
Try to meet in person at least once a week
