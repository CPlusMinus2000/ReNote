CS 398 Meeting Minutes

Date: January 14, 2022
Team: CKC

Present: Ivan, Adam, Henry, Colin
Absent:

Agenda: Discuss requirements, interviews, general direction
we need to decide if we're going for a more technical or less technical audience
how to store data, export files

Notes: Jeff says don't worry about technical details right now,
figure out what users want, that is the most important thing
also establish target audience and users

Decisions: Going for accessibility over technical capabilities (sorry Markdown)
Need to incorporate:
 - Rewind (*KILLER FEATURE*)
 - Rich formatting, tables, lists
 - Cloud support
 - Images (warning: hard)
 - Colours
 - Search
 - Sorting w/ timestamps
 - Handwriting (OPTIONAL, MAY BE DIFFICULT)

TODO:
Interview more users, wide range of users
Potentially have group interviews but probably one-on-one (figure it out as we go)
Afterwards we make personas and affinity charts, maybe in person??
